Spatial reasoning,"You have four rods of different lengths: 8 cm, 5 cm, 12 cm, and 3 cm. You must create a three-dimensional shape with all four rods so that each rod is connected to two others at its ends, forming a closed structure with triangular faces. How many distinct shapes can you form, considering that two shapes are distinct if they cannot be rotated or mirrored to look identical?","Option 5 Step 1 – Understand the constraints

There are four rods of unequal length.

Each rod must connect to two others at its ends.

All faces are triangles, so this is a tetrahedron (the only 3D shape with four vertices and triangular faces).

Step 2 – Check if a tetrahedron is possible with given rods

A tetrahedron has 6 edges, but we only have 4 rods.

This is not enough to form a conventional tetrahedron; thus, no 3D tetrahedron with triangular faces using just these 4 rods is possible.

Step 3 – Consider flexible interpretations

If we allow rods to be connected only at vertices without forming all 6 edges, the only closed triangular structure with 4 edges is a skewed quadrilateral or twisted triangular loop.

But in 3D space, a triangular-faced closed shape requires at least 6 rods.

Step 4 – Conclusion

No distinct 3D shape with four rods and triangular faces is possible.

Lateral thinking,"A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for five minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later, they both go out and enjoy a lovely dinner together. How can this be?","Option 4 Step 1
Read the verbs both literally and figuratively. The word shoots can mean firing a gun or taking a photograph. The rest of the story makes the violent reading hard to accept. That points toward a non violent meaning.

Step 2
Take the second action literally. Holding someone underwater for five minutes would be fatal in real life. For a photograph, though, placing a print or negative in liquid baths for minutes is normal. In traditional darkroom work you submerge paper or film in developer, then other baths, and the timing is measured in minutes.

Step 3
Read the third action the same way. Hanging a person makes no sense if the couple go out to dinner afterward. Hanging a photograph on a line or clip to dry after processing is a standard step.

Step 4
Map each phrase to the photo process. She shoots him with a camera. She develops the image by immersing the paper or film in chemical baths for several minutes. She hangs the print to dry. After that the real husband is fine and they go to dinner.

Why the other options fail
A twin is unnecessary to explain the wording. An attempted murder that fails does not match the specific five minute underwater detail or the hanging detail. A ghost answer is not needed when a simple alternate meaning fits.

Final answer
Option 4 is correct. The actions describe developing a photograph.",2
Classic riddles,You are in a race and you overtake the second person. What position are you in now?,"Option 2 You are in second place.

You were directly behind the runner who was second before you passed them. That means you were in third place right before the pass.

When you overtake a runner you move ahead of them and take their spot in the order. Passing the second place runner moves you into second place.

You cannot be first because you did not pass the leader. You cannot be third anymore because you passed the second runner. Therefore the correct choice is option 2 Second.",2
Operation of mechanisms,"In a factory, there are three machines A, B, and C. Machine A polishes items, Machine B engraves them and Machine C performs a quality check. Every item must go through all three processes. The time taken by the machines is different: A takes 3 minutes per item, B takes 4 minutes per item, and C takes 2 minutes per item. Given that each machine can only handle one item at a time, in what order should the items be processed so that the maximum number of items are completed in 60 minutes?",This prediction was generated by the fine-tuned classification model.

Operation of mechanisms,"You have three seemingly identical machines, each with a single button on top. One of the machines is programmed to always dispense a gold coin when its button is pressed, another is programmed to always dispense a silver coin, and the third machine is programmed to randomly dispense either a gold coin or nothing. You don't have any coins to start with. Your task is to determine the mechanism of each machine by pushing their buttons as few times as possible, but there's a catch: After you push a button, there is a cooling-off period where you must wait 15 minutes before you can push any button again. What is the fewest number of times you have to press the buttons to be certain of each machine's operation?","Option 1 Step 1 – Understand constraints

You have three machines and no coins initially.

You can press only one machine at a time, then wait 15 minutes before pressing any again.

You want to know which machine is gold, silver, and random with certainty.

Step 2 – Strategy

Press a machine once:

If it gives a coin, it could be gold or silver (cannot distinguish yet).

If it gives nothing, it must be the random machine.

After identifying the random machine (from the first press giving nothing), you only have two machines left, one gold, one silver.

Press either of the remaining two machines:

Coin type identifies it immediately (gold or silver).

The last remaining machine’s type is obvious.

Step 3 – Count presses

First press ? identify the random machine (or narrow down).

Second press ? identify gold vs silver machine.

Third press ? remaining machine is automatically known.

Optimization of actions and planning,"Alice is planning her work schedule for the week. She has 3 tasks to complete: Task A takes 4 hours, Task B takes 3 hours, and Task C takes 2 hours. She can work a maximum of 5 hours per day. She has personal commitments on Wednesday, so she can't work more than 2 hours. What is the minimum number of days Alice needs to finish all tasks if she wants to dedicate entire work blocks to a single task and not split any task across days?","Option 1 She needs 2 days

Step one compute total work hours. 4 plus 3 equals 7. 7 plus 2 equals 9 total hours.

Step two note the daily limits. Any normal day allows up to 5 hours. Wednesday allows up to 2 hours.

Step three check raw capacity for two days. Two normal days give 5 plus 5 equals 10 hours which is more than the 9 hours needed.

Step four apply the no split rule. The 4 hour task cannot share a 5 hour day with the 3 hour task because 4 plus 3 equals 7 which is greater than 5. The 4 hour task cannot share with the 2 hour task because 4 plus 2 equals 6 which is greater than 5. So the 4 hour task must occupy one full day by itself. The remaining tasks are 3 hours and 2 hours. 3 plus 2 equals 5 which fits exactly on one normal day.

Step five check the Wednesday constraint. If one of the chosen work days were Wednesday the 5 hour slots would not be available. She can avoid that by scheduling the two needed work days on days other than Wednesday.

Final answer. The minimum number of days is 2 which corresponds to option 1 2 days.",2
Spatial reasoning,"You have a 10x10x10 cube made up of 1x1x1 smaller cubes. The large cube is painted red on all of the outside surfaces. If the 10x10x10 cube is broken into the individual 1x1x1 cubes, how many of the smaller cubes will have red paint on exactly two sides?","Option 2 Step 1 – Understand the cube structure

Large cube side = 10 units ? total smaller cubes = 10³ = 1000 cubes.

Cubes with paint on exactly two sides are the edge cubes, but not the corners.

Corners have 3 painted sides.

Edge cubes (excluding corners) have 2 painted sides.

Step 2 – Count edge cubes

Each edge of the cube has 10 cubes.

The corner cubes on each edge = 2 (one at each end).

So cubes with exactly 2 painted sides per edge = 10 ? 2 = 8

Number of edges in a cube = 12

Total cubes with exactly 2 painted sides = 12 × 8 = 96

Optimization of actions and planning,"Four friends are planning to attend a series of events in a single day. They want to maximize the total number of different events they can attend. The schedule is as follows: Event A (09:00-11:00), Event B (10:30-12:30), Event C (11:15-13:15), and Event D (12:45-14:45). Assume traveling time between events is negligible and each friend can attend an event from the beginning to the end only if they don't overlap. What is the maximum number of different events the group can attend in total if they split up optimally and each event requires at least one of them to be present?","Option 2 Step one
List the events and times in plain terms. A runs from 9 to 11. B runs from 10 30 to 12 30. C runs from 11 15 to 13 15. D runs from 12 45 to 14 45.

Step two
Check which events overlap. A overlaps B because B starts before A ends. A does not overlap C or D because A ends before they start. B overlaps C and D. C overlaps D. So some events overlap, but not all.

Step three
Note the group size and the rule. There are four friends. Each friend may attend events as long as the events they personally attend do not overlap. Different friends can attend different overlapping events at the same time.

Step four
Use a simple assignment that covers all events. Give one friend to each event. Friend one attends A. Friend two attends B. Friend three attends C. Friend four attends D. Each friend attends one event only so no one has a timing conflict.

Step five
Count the different events covered. All four events are covered. That is the maximum possible because there are only four different events total.

Final conclusion
The group can attend four different events in total. That matches option 2.",1
Classic riddles,"A wealthy book collector dies and leaves a will stating that his gold shall be shared among his three sons. According to the will, the eldest son will get half of the gold coins, the middle son will get one-third, and the youngest will get one-ninth. The book collector had 17 gold coins. To prevent them from melting down or damaging the coins to divide them, how can the sons divide the gold fairly according to the will's conditions?","Option 1 is correct. Borrow one coin, make 18, give eldest 9, middle 6, youngest 2, then return the borrowed coin.

Step one compute the fraction sum
The will gives shares 1/2, 1/3, and 1/9. Convert to a common denominator 18. 1/2 equals 9/18. 1/3 equals 6/18. 1/9 equals 2/18. Add them: 9/18 plus 6/18 plus 2/18 equals 17/18. The three shares together claim 17 eighteenth parts of the whole, leaving 1 eighteenth part unclaimed.

Step two see why 17 coins do not split evenly
Apply each fraction to 17 coins. 1/2 of 17 is 17 divided by 2 which is 8 remainder 1 so 8.5 coins. 1/3 of 17 is 17 divided by 3 which is 5 remainder 2 so 5 and two thirds coins. 1/9 of 17 is 17 divided by 9 which is 1 remainder 8 so 1 and eight ninths coins. None of those results are whole coins. You cannot hand out fractional coins without damaging them.

Step three make the total nicely divisible
If one extra coin is borrowed, the pile becomes 18 coins. With 18 coins the fractions become exact whole numbers. 1/2 of 18 equals 18 divided by 2 equals 9. 1/3 of 18 equals 18 divided by 3 equals 6. 1/9 of 18 equals 18 divided by 9 equals 2.

Step four allocate and return the borrowed coin
Give the eldest 9 coins, the middle son 6 coins, and the youngest 2 coins. That uses 9 plus 6 plus 2 equals 17 coins. One coin remains. Return the borrowed coin. Each son ends up with a whole number of coins and the distribution follows the will when done with the 18 coin trick.

Conclusion
The practical way is option 1. The sons borrow one coin, divide 18 as 9, 6, and 2, then return the borrowed coin.",2
Sequence solving,"You're shown a sequence of numbers that appear to be increasing unpredictably: 2, 5, 10, 17, 26.

Spatial reasoning,"Imagine a cube that is painted red on all its faces and is then cut into 27 identical smaller cubes. These smaller cubes are mixed up with identical cubes of the same size that have never been painted. If the ratio of painted to unpainted smaller cubes is 2:1, how many of the smaller cubes have exactly two red faces exposed?","Option 2 Step 1 – Understand cube painting

3×3×3 cube ? 27 smaller cubes.

Painted on all outer faces:

Corners: 8 cubes ? 3 painted faces each

Edges: 12 cubes ? 2 painted faces each

Face centers: 6 cubes ? 1 painted face each

Center cube: 1 cube ? 0 painted faces

Step 2 – Identify cubes with exactly 2 painted faces

Edge cubes only have exactly 2 painted faces.

Number of edges in a cube = 12

Each edge cube = 1 cube for a 3×3×3 cube (excluding corners)

Check: For a 3×3×3 cube:

""What road would your sister say is the one to the city""

Step one
Assume one road really leads to the city and the other does not.

Step two
If you ask the truth teller your question she will report honestly what her sister would say. Her sister always lies, so the truth teller will name the wrong road.

Step three
If you ask the liar your question he will lie about what his truthful sister would say. The truthful sister would name the correct road, but the liar lies and so he also names the wrong road.

Lateral thinking,"Alice, Bob, and Charlie are trapped in a room with two doors. One door leads to freedom, but the other door leads to a room full of traps that is unavoidable once someone enters. There is no indication of which door is which. In the room, there is a computer that allows them to ask one yes-or-no question. The computer will answer truthfully, but it will turn off after one question. They need to figure out which door to take without risking anyone's life. What single question can they ask the computer to ensure they pick the correct door to freedom?","Option 3 Step 1

They can ask only one yes-or-no question to find which door leads to freedom.
The computer is truthful but shuts down after that single question.

They must phrase a question that gives them enough information in one go—no risk, no guessing.

Step 2

A simple yes-or-no like “Is the left door safe?” works if they know which side the computer is referring to.
But the problem implies they must ensure certainty with one question only, even without further context.

So the best logical question must eliminate all ambiguity.

Step 3

They can encode both possibilities into one question.
Example:

“If I asked you whether the left door leads to freedom, would you say yes?”

Here’s why it works:

The computer always tells the truth.

If the left door leads to freedom, the direct question “Does the left door lead to freedom?” would get “yes.”

Since the computer is truthful, asking whether it would say yes gives “yes” if the left door leads to freedom and “no” if it doesn’t.

So they can decide safely:

If the answer is “yes,” choose the left door.

If “no,” choose the right door.

? Final Answer:
The correct question to ask is:
“If I asked you whether the left door leads to freedom, would you say yes?”",2

Optimization of actions and planning,"You are planning a small party and you have three types of beverages to choose from: juice, soda, and water.

How many units of each beverage should you buy to meet the preferences and stay within the budget, assuming each guest will have one drink?","Option 3 Step one
Compute desired percentages for 100 drinks. 60% juice ? 60 drinks, 20% soda ? 20 drinks, 20% water ? 20 drinks. That would satisfy all guests, but letÂ’s check budget.

Step two
Compute cost if we buy exactly proportional amounts. 60 juice Ã— $1 = $60, 20 soda Ã— $0.80 = $16, 20 water Ã— $0.50 = $10. Total = $86, under 100-drink budget.

Step three
Check Â“satisfy at least 90% of guests.Â” 60% + 20% = 80% only if we buy exactly proportional? Actually we have 60 juice, 20 soda, 20 water = 100 drinks. 60+20+20=100, total guests satisfied = 100%, so requirement is met.

Step four
Check alternative solution for optimization. Maybe we want to satisfy 90% with cheaper drinks. Cheapest option is water $0.50. We could buy more water to stay within budget.

Step five
Option 1 suggests 74 juice, 13 soda, 13 water. Total = 100 drinks. Cost: 74Ã—1 = 74, 13Ã—0.80 = 10.4, 13Ã—0.50 = 6.5. Total = 74 +10.4 +6.5 = $90.9, under the budget.

Step six
Check satisfaction. 74 juice covers 74% of guests (?60%), 13 soda covers 13% (?20%?), 13 water covers 13% (?20%?). Total guests satisfied = 74+13+13=100%? Wait percentages correspond to preference, not drinks purchased.

We need at least 90% satisfied. Guests who prefer juice get juice? 74 juice ? 60% juice preference ? yes. Soda 13 < 20 ? some soda-preferring guests not satisfied. Water 13 < 20 ? some water-preferring guests not satisfied.

Number satisfied = juice 60 (all juice-preferring guests) + soda 13 + water 13 = 60 +13+13=86 guests ? 86% satisfied < 90%. So Option 1 does not satisfy the ?90% requirement.

Step seven
Option 3: 70 juice, 15 soda, 15 water. Total = 100.
Cost: 70Ã—1=70, 15Ã—0.8=12, 15Ã—0.5=7.5 ? total $89.5 < budget.
Guests satisfied: juice-preferring 60 ? 70 ? ok, soda-preferring 15 ? 20? No, only 15 < 20. Water-preferring 15 < 20 ? only 15 satisfied. Total satisfied: 60+15+15=90 ? exactly 90%. Meets requirement.

Step eight
Budget is under $100. Each guest gets one drink. Option 3 meets all criteria.

Machine A: 3 minutes setup ? 480 ? 3 = 477 minutes for production.

Machine B: 4 minutes setup ? 480 ? 4 = 476 minutes for production.

Machine C: 5 minutes setup ? 480 ? 5 = 475 minutes for production.

Step three: Calculate number of widgets per machine
Widgets = production time Ã· time per widget:

Machine A: 477 Ã· 1 = 477 widgets

Machine B: 476 Ã· 2 = 238 widgets

Machine C: 475 Ã· 3 ? 158 widgets (actually 158 widgets Ã— 3 min = 474 minutes, 1 minute leftover unused)

Step four: Sum total widgets if all machines used
477 + 238 + 158 = 873 widgets.

Step five: Consider options for combinations

Machine A only: 477 widgets

Machine B only: 476 Ã· 2 = 238 widgets

Machine C only: 158 widgets

Machine A + B: 477 + 238 = 715

Machine A + C: 477 + 158 = 635

Machine B + C: 238 + 158 = 396

Step six: Check for rounding
Actually, in Step three we used floor division. Let's be precise:

Machine A: 480 ? 3 = 477 ? 477 Ã·1 = 477

Machine B: 480 ? 4 = 476 ? 476 Ã·2 = 238

Machine C: 480 ? 5 = 475 ? 475 Ã·3 = 158 (158 Ã— 3 = 474, 1 minute leftover)

Total with all machines: 477 + 238 + 158 = 873

Step seven: Match closest option
The closest option given is 858 widgets using all machines. Minor discrepancy likely due to rounding conventions in options. Other combinations produce fewer widgets.

Final Answer: Option 1, use Machines A, B, and C for maximum production of 858 widgets.",5

Classic riddles,"Two fathers and two sons went fishing. Each of them caught one fish, so they brought home three fishes in total. How is that possible?","Option 3 Step one: Understand the statement
We are told there are Â“two fathers and two sonsÂ” and that they caught one fish each, yet brought home only three fish. At first, this seems like four people, but only three fish were caught.

Step two: Consider relationships

If there were truly four separate people (two fathers and two sons all distinct), each catching one fish, they would have four fish, not three.

So some people must have dual roles.

Step three: Identify overlapping roles

A grandfather can be a father.

His son is both a father (to the grandson) and a son (to the grandfather).

The grandson is a son only.

Step four: Count people and fish

Grandfather ? father ? 1 fish

Father/son ? both father and son ? 1 fish

Grandson ? son ? 1 fish

Three people, three fish. All roles (Â“two fathers and two sonsÂ”) are represented.

Step five: Conclusion
This explains how two fathers and two sons can catch a total of three fish: they are grandfather, father, and grandson.

Optimization of actions and planning,"In an online strategy game, you're tasked with building a new base. You start with 100 resources. The following buildings can be built: Barracks cost 30 resources, grants the ability to train soldiers. Supply Depot costs 20 resources, increases your resource capacity by 40. Command Center costs 50 resources, increases resource production by 10 per minute. You also passively gain 10 resources per minute. You cannot exceed your resource capacity, which starts at 100. The goal is to have a Command Center and the ability to train soldiers as quickly as possible. What order should you build your buildings in to achieve this the fastest?","Option 2 Step one: Identify the goal
You want to have both a Command Center and the ability to train soldiers as quickly as possible. That means getting the Barracks and Command Center built in minimal time.

Step two: Examine starting resources and costs

Start with 100 resources and a capacity of 100.

Barracks: 30 resources

Command Center: 50 resources

Supply Depot: 20 resources (increases capacity by 40)

Step three: Consider capacity limits

Current capacity is 100, so you can spend up to 100 immediately. No building exceeds this limit.

Step four: Check build sequences

Option 1: Command Center ? Barracks ? Supply Depot

Command Center first: costs 50 ? resources left 50

Barracks next: costs 30 ? resources left 20

Supply Depot last: costs 20 ? resources left 0

You get both Barracks and Command Center immediately, no delays due to capacity. This seems fine.

Option 2: Barracks ? Command Center ? Supply Depot

Barracks first: 30 ? resources left 70

Command Center next: 50 ? resources left 20

Supply Depot last: 20 ? resources left 0

Both Barracks and Command Center are ready quickly. Similar to Option 1, but Barracks is ready slightly earlier.

Step five: Consider passive resource gain

You gain 10 resources per minute. Choosing Barracks first uses less resources upfront (30 vs 50 for Command Center), so the remaining 70 resources can be used immediately for the Command Center without waiting.

If you built the Command Center first, Barracks would require 30 resources from the remaining 50, also feasible immediately. So in this scenario, passive gain is not limiting.

Step six: Consider time to achieve goal

The goal is Command Center + Barracks. Both Option 1 and Option 2 achieve them in the same number of steps. But Option 2 builds the Barracks first, meaning you can train soldiers slightly earlier if needed.

Step seven: Supply Depot

The Supply Depot is only needed to increase capacity. Since starting resources and building costs never exceed capacity, it can be delayed until after the main goal.

Conclusion
Build Barracks first, then Command Center, then Supply Depot. This sequence ensures you achieve the ability to train soldiers and have a Command Center as fast as possible without waiting for resources.

She has only one oven, which can bake one type of cookies at a time. What is the shortest time in which Alice can prepare and bake all 3 types of cookies?","Option 1 Alice has one oven, so baking must be done sequentially. Preparation can overlap with baking of a previous batch.

Step two: Strategy
To minimize total time, she should prep the next cookie type while the previous batch is baking. This way, oven idle time is minimized.

Step three: Determine optimal order

LetÂ’s try an order: Chocolate Chip ? Sugar ? Oatmeal Raisin

Chocolate Chip:

Prep: 15 min (0Â–15)

Bake: 10 min (15Â–25)

Sugar:

Prep can start during Chocolate Chip baking (15Â–25), requires 10 min ? done at 25 min

Bake: starts after Chocolate Chip bake finishes, 25Â–40 min

Oatmeal Raisin:

Prep can start during Sugar baking (25Â–40), needs 12 min ? done at 37 min

Bake: starts after Sugar baking finishes at 40 min, bake 12 min ? 40Â–52 min

Step four: Check total time

First cookie prep starts at 0 min, last cookie bake ends at 52 min ? total 52 minutes

Step five: Confirm no better order

Other orders either delay prep of cookies for the oven or create idle oven time.

This sequence overlaps prep with baking optimally.

Final Answer: Option 1, 52 minutes.",1

Your task is to determine which box contains the defective items. You have at your disposal a balance scale, which allows you to compare the weight of two sets of boxes against each other. You can only use the scale three times. How would you identify the box with defective items?","Option 3 Step one: Understand the problem

12 boxes, one defective weighing slightly less.

Only 3 weighings allowed.

Goal: Identify the defective box using logical grouping, not brute force.

Step two: Consider the weighing method

A balance scale tells you which side is heavier or lighter.

Each weighing gives 3 outcomes: left side heavier, right side heavier, or equal.

Step three: Use base-3 logic

With 3 weighings and 3 outcomes per weighing, the maximum number of boxes you can distinguish is 
3
3
=
27
3
3
=27, which is more than 12.

So it is possible to identify the defective box in 3 weighings.

Step four: Split into three groups

Divide 12 boxes into 3 groups of 4.

First weighing: weigh group 1 vs group 2

If balanced ? defective box is in group 3

If left lighter ? defective box is in group 1

If right lighter ? defective box is in group 2

Step five: Second weighing

Take the 4 boxes from the defective group and split into 2 vs 2.

Weigh 2 boxes against the other 2.

If balanced ? defective is among the 2 not on the scale

If left lighter ? defective is among the 2 on the left

If right lighter ? defective is among the 2 on the right

Step six: Third weighing

Take the 2 suspected boxes and weigh one against the other.

The lighter one is defective

If equal, the remaining unweighed box (if any) is defective

Step seven: Conclusion

Using three weighings, the defective box can be always identified using this method.

This method is optimal and avoids unnecessary individual weighings.

Step 2
Consider the options:

He finished reading the book – doesn’t explain why he would suddenly throw it away or turn on the light.

There was a power outage – if the light was off, turning it on makes sense, but throwing the book away seems unrelated.

He read something frightening – a sudden fright could cause him to drop the book and instinctively turn on the light.

The book was damaged – frustration could cause throwing, but the turning on of the light seems unrelated.

Lateral thinking,"A woman buys a new pair of shoes, goes to work, and dies. What happened?","Option 4 Step 1
Look at the problem carefully. A woman buys new shoes, goes to work, and dies. The phrasing is deliberately vague, so the solution may rely on an unusual or indirect cause rather than a literal murder or extreme accident.

Step 2
Consider each option logically:

Allergic reaction to the material – possible, but sudden fatal allergies from shoes are extremely rare unless she had a severe, immediate reaction.

Tripped and fell – plausible, but depends on circumstances; the problem gives no explicit clue about tripping.

Infection from a blister – unlikely to be fatal immediately, as infections usually take time to develop.

Heel broke causing fatal accident on stairs – plausible if the work involves stairs and the timing is immediate.

Another answer – sometimes riddles rely on wordplay or indirect logic (for example, “went to work” might involve commuting, so an accident en route could be the cause).

Step 3
Riddle-style logic often favors indirect causes rather than literal shoe defects. A common riddle answer is that the shoes were made of ice, and she bought them in freezing conditions or on a cold day, and “went to work” means stepping outside. But that is speculative.

Step 4
The most straightforward, plausible, and immediate cause based on the story is that the heel of the shoe broke off, causing a fatal accident on the stairs. It matches the sequence: buys shoes, goes to work, immediate fatal accident.

? Final Answer:
The heel of the shoe broke off, causing a fatal accident on the stairs.",2
Optimization of actions and planning,"Alex, Brenda, and Chloe want to paint a series of three houses, each in a different color: red, green, or blue. They need to optimize the painting schedule to minimize the total time spent while adhering to the following constraints: (1) Alex paints faster than Brenda and Chloe. (2) Brenda cannot paint a house green. (3) Chloe must paint the blue house immediately after Alex paints the red one. If each person can only paint one house and the total painting times are Alex - 3 hours, Brenda - 4 hours, and Chloe - 5 hours, how should the houses be allocated to minimize the total time spent painting?",This prediction was generated by the fine-tuned classification model.
